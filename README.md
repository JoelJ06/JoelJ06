# 👋 Hi, I'm Joel!

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for machine learning, accessible tech, and building things that make a difference. I enjoy exploring new technologies and solving real-world problems with code.

## 🛠️ Tech Interests

- Machine Learning & AI
- Accessible and human-centered software
- Full-stack development (Python, JavaScript, React, FastAPI, etc.)

## 📂 About My Projects

Some of my most interesting work can’t be shared publicly on GitHub due to licensing or confidentiality restrictions and/or is still being ported over. I’m also currently working on several new projects—stay tuned as I’ll be sharing them here soon! For more details about my experience, feel free to check out my resume or reach out.

## 🌱 Currently

- Diving deeper into AI research and open-source projects
- Always open to collaboration and learning new things!

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀  
*Let’s build something amazing together.*
